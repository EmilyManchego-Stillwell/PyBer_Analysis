# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis:
### Purpose:
- The purpose of this analysis was to see how the PyBer Ride Sharing was performing per type of city (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). To see how each city type was performing, we analyzed how the price of fares, number of riders, and number of drivers per each city type affected the data. 

### Results:
- This is a pie chart showing the percentage of total fares by city type. The light coral portion of the pie chart represents Urban cities, the light blue portion of the pie chart represents Suburban cities, and the yellow portion of the pie chart represents Rural cities.
